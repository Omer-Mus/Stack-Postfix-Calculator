# Stack-Postfix-Calculator

STACK PROJECT

Write a program that uses stacks to evaluate an arithmetic expression in infix notation without converting it into postfix notation. 

The program takes as input a numeric expression in infix notation, such as 3+4*2, and outputs the result.

1)   Operators are +, -, *, /
2)   Assume that the expression is formed correctly so that each operation has two arguments.
3)  The expression can have parenthesis, for example: 3*(4-2)+6. 
4)  The expression can have negative numbers.
5)  The expression can have spaces in it, for example: 3  *  (4-2)  +6 .


Here are some useful functions that you may need:

               char cin.peek(); -- returns the next character of the cin input stream ( without reading it)
               bool isdigit(char c); -- returns true if c is one of the digits ‘0’ through ‘9’, false otherwise
               cin.ignore(); -- reads and discards the next character from the cin input stream
               cin.get(char &c); -- reads a character in c ( could be a space or the new line )
